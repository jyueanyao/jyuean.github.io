          <p>👩🏻‍💻 I'm a product and UX designer currently based in Los Angeles. I was born and raised in Taiwan and moved to California for graduate school, where I'm pursuing a Master's in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology at USC.</p>
          <br> 
          <p>🎨 I've loved visual storytelling since I was a kid—I studied fine art in junior high and later discovered the power of design in solving real-world problems. My journey into UX began with designing for education-focused projects and working hands-on with user research and prototypes.</p>
          <br> 
          <p>🧠 I've worked on cross-disciplinary teams involving data analytics, IT, and design. My capstone project aimed to improve service experiences in Taiwan's long-term care system, and I've also created digital learning tools for young students in rural areas.</p>
          <br> 
          <p>📸 I also love capturing moments through my iPhone 16 Pro—whether it's spontaneous street scenes, quiet light, or short-form video. Photography and video editing are creative habits that fuel my design sense and storytelling intuition.</p>
              <br>  
          <p>🕺 Outside of work, I tap dance to clear my mind, go jogging to stay energized, read to explore new ideas, and meditate to reconnect with myself. Balance is part of my creative rhythm.</p>
